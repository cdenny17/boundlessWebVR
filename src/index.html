            <p>This is an immersive web experience. Using the three.js JavaScript 3D library to build a 3D environment and the webXR API you can bypass using a game engine like Unity and create Virtual Reality experiences and make them readily available to users on many devices. For this project I focused on the HTC Vive so the instructions below will help you connect a Vive to a web-based virtual reality environment that runs in a browser.</p>
