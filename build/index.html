Using the three.js JavaScript 3D library to build a 3D environment and the webXR API you can bypass using a game engine like Unity and create Virtual Reality experiences and make them readily available to users on many devices. For this project I focused on the HTC Vive so the instructions below will help you connect a Vive to a web-based virtual reality environment that runs in a browser.</p></div><div class="wrapper first"><div class="container chrome"><img src="src/image/chrome_logo.svg" alt="Chrome Canary Logo"><div><p>The webXR API is a new work in process. At the time of this release getting it to work requires use of Google Chrome with some settings changes. Follow this link to <a href="chrome://flags/">chrome://flags</a> to make settings changes to enable VR devices.</p><video autoplay loop muted src="src/image/webvr.mp4"></video><p>Enable these settings: WebVR | WebXR Device API | WebXR Hit Test | WebXR Plane Detection | Orientation sensors for XR | Oculus hardware support | OpenVR hardware support | Windows Mixed Reality support.</p><p>Disable this setting: XR device sandboxing.</p></div></div></div><div class="wrapper second"><div class="container vr"><img src="src/image/icons8-virtual-reality.svg" alt="Logo of VR HMD"><p>You also have to have a VR device. This particular project has been created and tested with the <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/setup/">HTC Vive</a>. The purpose of the webXR API is to integrate all VR and AR hardware with web base applications so in the future use of the Oculus or Google Cardboard is a possibility</p></div></div><div class="wrapper third"><div class="container steam"><img src="src/image/steam_icon_logo.svg" alt="Steam VR logo"><p>Download and run Steam and Steam VR. Steam acts as a bridge between the browser and the Vive. Even though this project bipasses the need to upload the VR content to Steam, it is impossible to eliminate Steam altogether at this time. Follow <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/HTC_Vive/">Steam's instructions</a> on downloading and setting up Steam VR using HTC Vive.</p></div></div></div><div id="enter"></div><footer class="wrapper"><div class="container"><p>This Project was Produced for the WSU Summer Mini Grant by Christian Denny Using the Immersive Web Group and W3C <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">webXR API</a> Photo by Steve Johnson from Pexels</p></div></footer><script src="./scripts/index.js"></script><script src="js/1.d8201da9.chunk.js"></script><script src="js/app.7e93823e.js"></script></body></html>
